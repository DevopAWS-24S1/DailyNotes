# Special Variables:
   * Shell scripting also has special variables like `$0`, `$1`, `$@`, `$*`, etc., which hold special meanings. For instance, `$0` holds the name of the script itself, `$1`, `$2`, etc., hold positional parameters, and `$@` holds all positional parameters.

   Example:
   ```bash
   echo "Script name: $0"
   echo "All arguments: $@"
   echo " Last command status: $?"

- `=`: Checks if two strings are equal
- `!=`: Checks if two strings are not equal
- `-z`: Checks if the length of a string is zero
