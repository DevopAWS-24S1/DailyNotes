# Vitual machine / Virtual server / Server
* Image your laptop -- Components like Hardware,RAM , CPU , HardDisk --Physical machine / Physical server 
* Vitual machine  - It is also same like your Physical machine , but it is not available with you. Access it by using internet .

# Where the servers are created ..?
1. On-premise
2. Cloud

* On both On-premise and clous we aill have datacenters 
* Datacenters - large infrastucture --  RAM / CPU / Harddisk -- 100GB - 100 CPU 100GB harddisk 
* Createa a server - 1 GB RAM / 1 CPU / 50 GB harddisk 


# On premise :
* Initial cost is very high - Setup datacenter and infrastcture 
* Require maintanence team to manage and maintain the datacenter 

# Cloud:

* AWS , Azure , GCP -- cloud providers 
* Create a account with the cloud provider and use the services.
* Pay for the services we used.


* If the applications are own applictions , it is better to use the Onpremise 
* If you are providing some service to the application , it is better to go with Cloud.

# Amazon.in -- Onpremise 
1. Security 
2. More efficient in the long run 


# Cloud -- not your  own applications :
1. Tt is better to go with cloud provider to avoid initial cost

# Operating sytem:
* Popular Operating systems
* Linux 
* Windows 

* Servers - 96% are linux based operating systems in the server world 
* Linux is the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of the top one million web servers' operating systems are Linux

* Two kinds of Interface:
1. GUI - Graphical User Interface -- 
2. CLI - Command Line Interface- Command to interact with the OS / Server 

* In IT world we use only CLI for the linux severs , if you want to host your application
* Windows servers we will have GUI /CLI 

* In Windows - window7/windows8/windows10/
* In Linux - mutliple kinds of operating systems 
* Ex: - redhat , centos , ubuntu , amazon linux 2 
* Motor bikes - Engine would be same - on top of it there will be customizations and they name its as companies like - KTM , pulsar , BMW , triumph, benelli 
* Linux is a kernel 
* Linux is developed a linus Torvalds 

# How Linus OS Works Internally ..?
* CLI >> Shell Kernel >> Hardware 
* If someone quering on the CLI , the process goes from  CLI >> Shell Kernel >> Hardware and again back to the CLI with the output .

# If you want to work on any operating System:
1. UserManagement
2. PackageManagement
3. ServiceManagement 
4. ProcessMangement
5. NetwrokMangement 

# Create a server in AWS  
* Install gitbash on your laptop , which is SSH client that helps to connect to the server
* Connect to the server using ssh client(gitbash) and the run the  command copied from the AWS console 
* Logout from the server - exit or ctrl+d

# Linux commnads:
* pwd - present working directory 
* ls - list the files and folders in the PWD 
* ls -l -- list lot 
* d at the starting - directory/folder 
* cd - change directory 
* cd .. - one folder backward 
* ls -lt  >> sort by time  -- newest first 
* ls -ltr >> sort by time and reverse  -- oldest first 
* Any file starting with  '.' is acalled as hidden file/folder 
* ls -a  >> list hidden files and folders
